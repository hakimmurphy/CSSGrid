        <p class="bio">Since my youth, I believe that music has touched me in a way that made me fall in love with its
            rhythms, harmonies, and melodies. So in the natural progression dancing took over my body, but yet my soul
            craved for more and that is when playing records surfaced. Ah, then the fascination with the fast dance
            tracks turned into deep House production through friends and experiences, which then blossomed into a
            Bachelorâ€™s degree in music composition. Liberal arts training allowed me to take classes and learn about
            human intellect, nature, and essentially my personal definition of art. Synapsis Records and Machining
            Dreams record labels are born and are currently releasing music by, for, and from the underground. Then
            after learning the craft, collaborations were born as I am part of Innerspace Halflife, Pegasus Heat,
            Resonating, Hardware Hustlerz, Slowmotion, and Dream Scoring.</p>

            Freedom - <br>
            <br>
            Exploring different cultures is a must. <br>
            Touching down on foreign soil feels unbelievable. <br>
            The smells, the language, the environment is lush. <br>
            To arrive somewhere you never dreamed, unconceivable. <br>
            <br>
            To mix and match is good for the soul. <br>
            Reproducting and making new mates for strong genes. <br>
            The experiences you construct are worth more than gold. <br>
            Plus the exotic ones always make you cream. <br>
            <br>
            As it seems, the liberatio, it's ways and means. <br>
            Are pure and unbridedled bliss. <br>
            Unless the powers that be coerce you into something not keen. <br>
            Than it is too late when you realize something is a miss. <br>
            <br>
            Vibrations are preceived through an extra sense. <br>
            General to a point that transcends human constructs. <br>
            Reflections are the cousins and the simularities are immense. <br>
            Luckily distance keeps most of the unsavery elements from running amok. <br>
            <br>
            Slavery is the opposite of freedom. <br>
            Freedom is similar to liberty. <br>
            Liberty encapsulates capitalism. <br>
            Capitalism is slavery, the opposite of liberation. <br>

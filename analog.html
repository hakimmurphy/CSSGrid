            Analog - <br>
            <br>
            The new world is digital so analog will become a thing of the past. So we think or it is
            apparant. Saving data to DNA strands because there are limited resources. Perhaps analog will again become
            prevalent, all it takes is one EMP, artificial intelligence or otherwise to change the course of history.
            <br>
            <br>
            From a music perspective no one records straight analog anymore.
            It is however a sought out sound that is easy yet expensive to implement.
            Fluffy, light, warm are objectives associated with this concept. <br>
            <br>
            Analog my olf friend <br>
            Warm slightly fuzzy to the very end. <br>
            No electricity, no problem <br>
            No computer, I got it <br>
            We use our minds to solve an issue <br>
            Doing things like the prehistoric humanism <br>
            <br>
            Digital has clearly won the war <br>
            Technology is something you can't ignore. <br>

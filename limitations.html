            Limitations - <br>
            <br>
            A human construct or reality, <br>
            whichever the case, <br>
            it's not sad to me. <br>
            <br>
            If you cannot do something, <br>
            suck it up, <br>
            but don't do nothing.<br>
            <br>
            Life goes on, <br>
            in all forms, <br>
            but for some this is not the norm. <br>
            <br>
            Phyical, mental, emotional, <br>
            are types of intelligence, <br>
            does not exceeding in one make you irrelevant? <br>
            <br>
            Questions, among the vastly unanswered, <br>
            like conolonization of other planets? <br>
            Or ending racism on this one; damn it. <br>
            <br>
            I wish I could fly. <br>
            Or see through walls, <br>
            and hear conversations invisible like a fly. <br>

            I wish i had super speed. <br>
            Or could comphrehend everything. <br>
            Unfortunately limitation are a thing.<br>
